# Info_aidtech_ML Internship

🎉 **Completed Info_aidtech_ML Internship** 🎉

During my Info_aidtech_ML Internship, I had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects in the field of Machine Learning. Here's a brief overview of the tasks I successfully completed:

## Project 1: Iris Flower Classification 🌼
- Developed a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their petal and sepal characteristics.



## Project 2: Movie Recommendation System 🍿
- Created a recommendation system using collaborative filtering on the MovieLens dataset.
- The MovieLens dataset is available on Kaggle; you can download it from [Kaggle's MovieLens Dataset]([insert Kaggle link here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jneupane12/movielens)).



## Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳
- Implemented a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms.
- Ensured robust security by identifying fraudulent transactions accurately.


I thoroughly enjoyed working on these projects and learned a lot during my internship. If you're interested in exploring the code and the detailed project documentation, please visit the GitHub repositories linked above.

Thank you to the Info_aidtech team for this incredible learning experience! 🚀
